## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I got more familiar with CSS Grid, and how to use it coupled with Flexbox. It was a project with a layout a bit more complex than the previous challenges I completed, and I'm happy with the results. I can see my progress and this is a huge help for my motivation.

I didn't use the "Mobile first" approach because I was more focused on nailing the desktop grid layout.
