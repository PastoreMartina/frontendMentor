### What I learned

As I'm just at the beginning of my learning journey, this project was a good challenge and taught me a lot.

The things I learned during this project go from very small (how to style the hr element) to a bit more complex (how to activate an overlay effect while hovering).

I used Flexbox in practice for the first time, and I think I'm getting the hang of it.
