### What I learned

I used this challenge to teach myself CSS Grid! It was a lot of fun, even if a bit demanding at times. I'm mostly satisfied with the result, but I know my solution could certainly be improved and optimized. I still have a lot to learn about CSS Grid, but I can now say that I understand the basics.

### Continued development

I'd like to learn how to use Tailwind CSS sooner or later, but I'm not sure if I'm ready yet.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Grid guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - I couldn't have done it without this guide!!
