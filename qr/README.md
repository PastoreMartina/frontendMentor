## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS - Flexbox

### What I learned

This was a rather basic challenge, so it was perfect for my basic knowledge of CSS. The biggest challenge was to center the card vertically as well as horizontally. Initially I centered it using absolute positioning, but after recieving some feedback I tried Flexbox.

I learned about ARIA roles and their importance for accessibility, even if I didn't implement them in this project.

I also learned that in typography, ems/rems are more accessibility-friendly than pixels.

### Continued development

I'd like to better understand how to use the different layout models (Flexbox and CSS Grid).
I'd also like to try a pre-processor (Sass or maybe Less).
I have to deepen my knowledge of responsive design and accessibility best practices.

### Useful resources
