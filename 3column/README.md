## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS Framework

### What I learned

Even if it is a simple layout, I really pushed myself HARD with this challenge!! 

I had never used a CSS framework before, and I used this project to learn Tailwind. I don't know JavaScript yet and I'm just recently getting familiar with the command line, so even setting everything up was a big hurdle, before writing any code.

I really enjoy how easy it is to make the page responsive with Tailwind. 

I'm excited to get better with this new powerful resource!
